## Description
A website with a map full screen of cars as read from the server

## Implementation
The project does not work as specified. The tool does not read dynamic content,
although it does take content from the server. The tool does not make a polyline
or information window. The tool does not mark the closest vehicle. The tool does
have an extra feature used in testing but not removed because of usefulness which
is upon the click of car, the username of the car appears in a notification.

## Collaboration
I did not collaborate on this lab with anyone.

## Time Commitment
I spent around 16-18 hours working on this project.
